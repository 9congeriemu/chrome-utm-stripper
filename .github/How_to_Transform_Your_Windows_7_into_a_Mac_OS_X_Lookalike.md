There are many theme packs that can transform your Windows 7 into a Mac OS X lookalike, but not all of them are compatible with the 64 bit version of Windows. Here are some of the theme packs that we recommend for Windows 7 64 bit users:
 
- **MacOS Transformation Pack**: This theme pack includes a login screen, wallpapers, themes, fonts, cursors, icons, sounds, finderbar, dock, spaces, dashboard, and launchpad. It also integrates the macOS look into Windows desktops and lets you customize some settings before installation. You can download it from [here](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/Snow-Transformation-Pack.shtml) [^2^].
- **MacOS Big Sur 2**: This theme pack is based on the latest version of Mac OS X and provides various iOS graphical elements.

To install any of these theme packs, you need to follow these steps:

2. Extract the downloaded file using a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Run the setup file or apply the components as instructed by the theme pack creator.

## Conclusion
 
With these theme packs, you can enjoy the look and feel of Mac OS X on your Windows 7 64 bit system without changing your operating system. However, keep in mind that these theme packs do not actually install any Apple-related applications or features on your PC. They only change the appearance of your desktop and some system resources.
