# How to Use Alcor USB Flash Drive Tools to Fix Fake USB Drives
 
USB flash drives are convenient devices for storing and transferring data, but they can also be prone to fraud and corruption. Some USB flash drives on the market claim to have a certain capacity, but only deliver a fraction of that. This is sometimes referred to as fake 'oversize capacity'. These drives may appear to have the stated capacity in Windows Properties, but when you try to write or read data from them, you may encounter errors, data loss, or corruption.
