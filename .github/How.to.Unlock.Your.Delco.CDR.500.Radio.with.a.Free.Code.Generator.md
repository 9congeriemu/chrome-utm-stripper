## What is the Delco CDR 500 radio code generator?
 
The Delco CDR 500 radio code generator is a website that can calculate the unlock code for your radio based on its serial number and security number. These numbers are usually printed on a sticker on the side or back of the radio, or on a card that came with the radio when you bought it. If you don't have these numbers, you might need to remove the radio from the dashboard and look for them.
 
The website is easy to use and works for most models of Delco CDR 500 radios. However, it does not work for radios signed by VDO Siemens, only for radios made by DELCO. You can check the manufacturer of your radio by looking at the logo on the front panel.

3. Press and hold button 6 until you hear a beep or see "CODE" disappear from the screen. This means your radio is unlocked and ready to use.

If you enter an incorrect code or make a mistake, you can try again by pressing button 6. However, be careful not to enter a wrong code more than three times in a row, as this will lock your radio permanently and no one can help you.
