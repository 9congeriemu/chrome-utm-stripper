# How to Install Intel Ibex Peak PCH Host Embedded Controller Interface Driver
 
The Intel Ibex Peak PCH Host Embedded Controller Interface (HECI) driver is a software component that allows the operating system to communicate with the Intel chipset components. The HECI driver is also known as the Chipset INF Utility, and it is useful for ensuring that all Windows INF files are installed for OS identification and to reduce yellow bangs in Device Manager[^1^].

If you have an Intel chipset-based system or motherboard, you may need to install or update the HECI driver to improve the performance and stability of your device. In this article, we will show you how to download and install the latest HECI driver for your system.
 
## Step 1: Check your system compatibility
 
Before you download and install the HECI driver, you need to check if your system is compatible with it. The HECI driver supports Intel chipset products from the 6th generation (Skylake) to the 11th generation (Tiger Lake) and some legacy platforms. You can find a list of supported products on the Intel website[^2^].
 
To check your system compatibility, you can use the Intel Driver & Support Assistant (Intel DSA), which is a tool that automatically detects and updates drivers and software for your Intel hardware. You can download and install Intel DSA from here: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html
 
After installing Intel DSA, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. It will scan your system and show you a list of available updates. If you see the HECI driver in the list, you can download and install it from there.
 
## Step 2: Download the HECI driver manually
 
If you prefer to download the HECI driver manually, you can do so from the Intel Download Center. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Go to https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/17250/intel-chipset-device-software-for-heci.html
2. Select your operating system from the drop-down menu.
3. Click on the Download button next to the file name that matches your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
4. Save the file to a convenient location on your computer.

## Step 3: Install the HECI driver
 
After downloading the HECI driver, you need to install it on your system. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Locate the downloaded file and double-click on it to launch the installer.
2. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process.
3. Restart your computer when prompted.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the HECI driver on your system. You can now enjoy the benefits of improved communication between your operating system and your Intel chipset components.
  
## Step 4: Verify the installation
 
To verify that the HECI driver is installed correctly, you can check the Device Manager and look for the Intel Management Engine Interface device under System devices. If you see a yellow exclamation mark next to it, it means that there is a problem with the driver and you may need to reinstall it or update it. If you see a green check mark next to it, it means that the driver is working properly and you are good to go.
 
## Benefits of HECI driver
 
The HECI driver enables the host operating system to communicate directly with the Management Engine integrated in the chipset. This allows the host and ME to exchange system management information and events in a standards-compliant way, essentially replacing the System Management Bus (SMBus) that was used before[^3^].
 
Some of the benefits of using the HECI driver are:

- It improves the performance and stability of your system by allowing the host and ME to coordinate power management, thermal management, fan control, network wake, boot device selection, system inventory and more.
- It reduces the cost and complexity of your system by eliminating the need for additional components and routing that were required for SMBus.
- It supports Intel chipset products from the 6th generation (Skylake) to the 11th generation (Tiger Lake) and some legacy platforms, making it compatible with a wide range of systems and motherboards.
- It does not require non-Intel drivers or software, making it OS independent and easy to install and update.

The HECI driver is an essential component for Intel chipset-based systems that support Active Management Technology (AMT), which is a feature that allows remote access, monitoring and management of your system. AMT can help you improve security, reduce downtime, save energy and more.
